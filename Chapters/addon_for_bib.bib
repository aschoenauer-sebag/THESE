    abstract = {{Achieving complete understanding of any living thing inevitably requires thorough analysis of both its anatomic and dynamic properties. Live-cell imaging experiments carried out to this end often produce massive amounts of time-lapse image data containing far more information than can be digested by a human observer. Computerized image analysis offers the potential to take full advantage of available data in an efficient and reproducible manner. A recurring task in many experiments is the tracking of large numbers of cells or particles and the analysis of their (morpho)dynamic behavior. In the past decade, many methods have been developed for this purpose, and software tools based on these are increasingly becoming available. Here, we survey the latest developments in this area and discuss the various computational approaches, software tools, and quantitative measures for tracking and motion analysis of cells and particles in time-lapse microscopy images.}},

abstract = {Particle tracking is of key importance for quantitative analysis of intracellular dynamic processes from time-lapse microscopy image data. Because manually detecting and following large numbers of individual particles is not feasible, automated computational methods have been developed for these tasks by many groups. Aiming to perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition in which participating teams applied their own methods independently to a commonly defined data set including diverse scenarios. Performance was assessed using commonly defined measures. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical conclusions for users and developers.},

@article{Wahlby2002,
abstract = {Automatic cell segmentation has various applications in cytometry, and while the nucleus is often very distinct and easy to identify, the cytoplasm provides a lot more challenge. A new combination of image analysis algorithms for segmentation of cells imaged by fluorescence microscopy is presented. The algorithm consists of an image pre-processing step, a general segmentation and merging step followed by a segmentation quality measurement. The quality measurement consists of a statistical analysis of a number of shape descriptive features. Objects that have features that differ to that of correctly segmented single cells can be further processed by a splitting step. By statistical analysis we therefore get a feedback system for separation of clustered cells. After the segmentation is completed, the quality of the final segmentation is evaluated. By training the algorithm on a representative set of training images, the algorithm is made fully automatic for subsequent images created under similar conditions. Automatic cytoplasm segmentation was tested on CHO-cells stained with calcein. The fully automatic method showed between 89\% and 97\% correct segmentation as compared to manual segmentation.},
