Biological screens test large sets of experimental conditions with
respect to their specific biological effect on living systems. Recent
progresses have made it possible to apply such approaches at a large
scale, involving thousands of experiments. 

In time-lapse microscopy, images are acquired over time. Such
experiments allow studying dynamic biological processes. But they
generate large complex datasets, which are more difficult to analyze:
one needs to combine robust image analysis algorithms with efficient
statistical methods.  

This thesis addresses these challenges and shows the applicability of
the developed frameworks. It presents e.g. the first multivariate
workflow for the study of single cell motility in such data, the
development of a new approach for drug target inference, and a
complete methodological pipeline for performing such screens in
Environmental Toxicology, together with its visualization
Web-interface.
